    <h2>What exactly is Badam ragda?</h2>
    <p>The state of Haryana is famous for a variety of things, one being the passion for wrestling. It goes without saying that some of the country’s best wrestlers have emerged from the North Indian state, putting the nation on the world map with their wins in coveted international tournaments like the Olympics and Commonwealth. Vijendar Singh to Geeta Phogat, the list is huge. It almost makes you wonder, ‘what is the secret to their energy?’ Now, it won’t be fair to assume that the entire region eats the same meal. 

    </p>
    <p>But the culture of eating local, seasonal food is very prevalent here. Haryana is one of the most fertile plains of India, so a bevy of grains, pulses, millets and cereals make it to their daily diet. Besides, energy-inducing foods like sugarcane and jaggery are also common features. There’s much emphasis on nuts and dry fruits too, together, they help boost energy, increase brain power and induce strength. Since most of these nuts are also decent sources of protein, a bunch of these nuts and dry fruits are crushed and consumed with milk and yogurt. You must have heard of the Indian smoothie Lassi, but have you ever heard of the Badam Ragda, the OG power drink and protein shake of the pehlwaans of India. </p>
